<li><h3>About the Game</h3></li>
<p>This is a simple and elegant game where you can play Rubik's Cube from your own web browser.</p>
<p>Each of the six faces of the Rubik's cube is in one of the six colors - red, green, yellow, blue, white, and orange.<p>
<p>The visible part of the cube is divided into 26 pieces - 6 central pieces (only one colored side), 12 edge pieces (two colored sides), and 8 corner pieces (three colored sides).</p>
<p>The 26 pieces are "scrambled" to have different colors on each face.</p>
